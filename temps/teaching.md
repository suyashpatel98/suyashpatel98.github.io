  title={QUEST for MEDISYN: Quasi-norm based Uncertainty ESTimation for MEDical Image SYNthesis},
  author={Uddeshya, Upadhyay* and Viswanath P., Sudarshan* and Suyash, Awate},
  abstract={Uncertainty quantification in medical imaging is
  critical for clinical translation of deep learning-
  based methods. Modality propagation within the
  context of medical imaging is a problem of inter-
  est, both across as well as within modalities. For
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), often, multi-
  contrast MRI images are acquired for improved
  diagnosis and prognosis. In this work, we focus
  on the synthesis of T2w MRI images from T1w
  MRI images. Prior works used generative adver-
  sarial networks (GANs), but lack (i) uncertainty
  quantification, (ii) evaluating the robustness of
  the network to out-of-distribution data (common
  in medical imaging). We propose a robust GAN
  framework that incorporates uncertainty quantifi-
  cation using quasi-norm based penalties, and also
  show the efficacy of the method on unseen sys-
  temic and physiological perturbations on a large
  publicly available multimodal MRI dataset.},
