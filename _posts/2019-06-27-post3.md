In my last internship at Synapsica I was working on the problem on measuring the diameter (in mm) of the spinal canal and foraminals (if present) in axial spinal MR images. Such measurements can help diagnose spinal stenosis which is a common condition in ageing population. This post provides an intuitive summary of the methods involved, please refer to the paper for the details.

The problem was solved in two different steps.

The first step was to ensure that the most important region from MRI scan was chosen and the rest of the scan is discarded. The following figure shows that most of the scan is irrelevant for this task and only a small reigion near the centre corresponds to the location of spinal canal and foraminals.

This step was performed by a segmentation network which segmented the relevent region from the scan. We used segmentation network because we found it much easier to train than R-CNN based methods.

The second step was to identify the spinal canal and the formainals in the above isolated important region. This was again done through a segmentation network. An important point to note is that the required length is first measured in pixels and then converted to mm using the scaling factor present in the dicom file. Hence an error of single pixel in measurement on original resolution may amount to significant error in mm. To reduce the error in the final measurement, the important region extracted in step 1 is resized to higher resolution, as a pixel error in higher resolution is less severe than pixel error in the original lower resolution. The following figure shows the high resolution cropped image and the corresponding label map to be used for training the segmentation network.

Entire pipeline consists of the first model to extract the relevant crop-section from the MR image, resizing the crop section to higher resolution and passing it through the second network predicting the masks for spinal canal and formainals. The following figure shows the entire pipeline.

The following are some qualitative results obtained from this framework, kindly refer to the paper for quantitative analysis.
