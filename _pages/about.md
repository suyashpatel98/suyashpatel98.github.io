## Who am I?
Hey, there! Uddeshya here. 

I hold a bachelor's and a master's degree in [Computer Science and Engineering from IIT-Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). 
Having a research bent of mind, I am fascinated by interdisciplinary RnD work happening at the intersection of 
computer science, machine learning, biomedical engineering, and healthcare analytics.
These days I am exploring Bayesian Deep Learning, Uncertainty Estimation, and Explainable AI (XAI) for vision-based applications
([follow me for updates!](https://twitter.com/uddupa)).

As an undergrad at IIT-B, I worked closely with [Prof. Suyash P Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) on 
robust deep generative models for computer vision, quality enhancement, and uncertainty estimation using Bayesian Deep Learning techniques. I also worked with [Prof. Biplab Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/) on representation learning.
In past, I've had wonderful opportunities to work with [Prof. Arjun Jain](http://arjunjain.co.in/), [Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay](https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ANUPAM) (summer intern, 2017), and [Dr. Eric Nichols](https://www.jp.honda-ri.com/en/author/e.nichols/) (summer intern, 2018).

<!-- I was also fortunate to collaborate with some awesome organizations like,

BTW, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A) a cool lofi track that I find helpful while working.
<br/>
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obCjODeoLVw) a video of Prof. R. Feynman talking about Mathematician vs. Physicists. <br/>
I believe something similar can be said for Researchers vs. Engineers.
